# Iris-Detection
Deep Iris Detection Model using Python and Tensorflow
This project implements a real-time eye detection and classification system using a custom-trained VGG16 model. It detects open/closed eyes and localizes the right and left eyes as colored points (red for right eye, green for left eye) on human faces.

Key Features
Real-time face & eye detection.

Localizes right eye (ðŸ”´) and left eye (ðŸŸ¢) with dot markers.

Classifies each eye as open or closed.

Uses a custom dataset of face images annotated with eye keypoints.

Fine-tuned VGG16 model with dual-task output:

Eye state classification (binary)

Eye position prediction (keypoint coordinates)

Dataset
Collected manually from Google images (open and closed eyes).

Annotated using LabelMe for:

Right eye (x, y)

Left eye (x, y)

Eye state (open = 1, closed = 0)

Augmentations applied with Albumentations:

Random crop

Brightness/contrast

Horizontal flip

Gamma correction

Split into:

train/

val/

test/

Each sample includes:

The face image.

A label file with:

Left and right eye keypoints.

Binary eye state.

Model Architecture
Base Model: VGG16 (pretrained on ImageNet, feature extractor).

Custom Heads:

Eye State Classification (open/closed).

Eye Position Regression (left & right eye keypoints).

Loss Functions:
Binary Cross-Entropy Loss for eye state classification.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) for keypoint (dot) regression.
